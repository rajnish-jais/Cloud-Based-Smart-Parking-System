## Problem Statment
The common method of finding an available parking space is manual and cost inefficient. This method takes time and effort where the user may or may not find a free space to park his vehicle in large cities where vehicle density is high.

## Few Statistics

 * Implies more than 8235 hour i.e. almost a year of his life .
 * The short stay parking space doesn’t reach the 60% average occupancy.

## Problem:
  * Drivers gets frustrated.
  * Parking Management Company can’t maximize their revenue.

## Solution

* Number of free slots available in car-park areas is shown on the website where user can reserve parking space by making payment.
* The website shows costs of a parking space requested by user based on duration for which the parking space is required by the user.
## Summary
